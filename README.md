Week 3 Status:
HTML, CSS, and JS files created
HTML and CSS have one tab with 3 columns of numbers and buttons implemented. Prototype dropdown information on top of left column.
JS has generic functions for updating resource values and writing to the locations where values are displayed in the html.
JS also has functions for handling updates to resource values and calculating their velocitys, and a global clock for updating these values.
Future updates will hopefully improve in speed as more generic functions are added.

Next goal is to add sliders to the html, and cycling numbers behaviour to the JS.
