Anti-Linear-Incremental

aledavis@pdx.edu

This is a project focusing on the development of an incremental game. The design goals of the game are to provide an experience that minimizes the idle gameplay that is central to the majority of incremental games while maximizing both the length and difficulty of the game as a whole. 

These goals will be met by having the game regularly introduce game-play mechanics of increasing difficulty such that the majority of the game-play time will be spent understanding how the different mechanics interact with each other. To minimize confusion, there will be periods of time where inexperienced players will be able to progress at some speed so that there is a sense of progression, followed by times where only players who have understood the game mechanics properly will succeed to ensure that players do not fall behind in understanding later on.
